GoSquared for Magento
=====================

How to Install
--------------

The easiest way to install the extension is to head over to Magento Connect and get the Extension key to put straight into your Connect Manager of your Magento install.

How to Setup
------------

Navigate to the backend of your Magento installation, and head to System > Configuration on the menu bar.

On the Configuration page, scroll down to the GoSquared heading in the sidebar and select Settings.

This page allows you to input your GoSquared Site Token for your website (which can be found at [http://home.gosquared.com/developer](http://home.gosquared.com/developer)) into the input area provided. Note that it will start with "GSN".

Finally you are able to configure how you want the extension to work by choosing if you want admin pages tracked and how users should be displayed in the GoSquared Dashboard.
